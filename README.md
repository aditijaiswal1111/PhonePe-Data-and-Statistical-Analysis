# PhonePe-Data-and-Statistical-Analysis


## Introduction
The PhonePe Pulse dataset provides anonymized aggregate data on digital payments in India. This analysis aims to explore and understand the trends in digital payments over time, focusing on transactions, users, and insurance.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Initial exploration revealed potential issues such as missing values and formatting inconsistencies.
- Data was cleaned by standardizing date formats, handling missing values, and removing outliers.

## Deredundancy and Database Design
- The dataset was organized into a database structure with normalized tables to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- Primary keys were identified, and irrelevant attributes were discarded.

## Exploratory Data Visualization
- Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots were generated to understand data distribution and relationships.
- Clear interpretations of visualizations were provided to gain insights into digital payment trends.

## Descriptive Statistics
- Basic statistics including mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance were calculated.
- Correlations between variables were explored to understand their relationships.

## Research Question/Hypothesis
- A research question was formulated based on the initial exploration to guide further analysis and insights into digital payment trends.

## Advanced Data Analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimensionality reduction to identify significant features influencing digital payment trends.
- Clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical clustering were utilized on the reduced feature space to identify natural groupings within the data.
- Results were compared between direct clustering and clustering on the reduced space to validate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction.
- Attribute importance identification was performed by inverting clusters back to the original dimensions to determine the most influential attributes.

## Text Mining
- If applicable, text mining techniques were applied to extract valuable insights from textual data in the dataset.

## Interpretation and Discussion
- Findings and analyses were interpreted and discussed to provide meaningful insights into digital payment trends in India.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
- Conclusions were drawn based on the analysis, highlighting key trends and insights.
- Recommendations were provided for stakeholders to leverage the insights gained from the analysis for strategic decision-making in the digital payment space.

Overall, this analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of digital payment trends in India and provides valuable insights for various stakeholders in the payments ecosystem.
